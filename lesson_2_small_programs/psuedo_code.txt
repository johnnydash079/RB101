# a method that returns the sum of two integers

# casual psuedo code
given two integers
add integer one and integer two together

# formal psuedo code
START

GET two integers from the user
SET first integer to integer_one
SET second integer to integer_two
SET sum = integer_one + integer_two
PRINT sum

# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# casual psuedo code
given an array of strings
iterate through the array one by one
append each array element to a new string variable

START

given an array of strings called strings

# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
every_other([1,4,7,2,5]) # => [1,7,5]

given an array of integers
iterates through every other element of the array, starting with element 1
assign each element to a variable

# a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

# casual psuedo code
given a string
given a character
iterate through each character of string
 - when third occurence of given character is found, return the index of the character
- if character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil

given a character call char

# a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:
merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

# casual psuedo code
given two arrays of numbers with same size/length
iterate through both arrays simultaneously
  - with each iteration add the element from each array to the end of a new array in the order the array was entered
